# MOD20 Types

This repo contains the shared TypeScript types for the MOD20 project â€” a modular tabletop RPG system built off the D&D 5e OGL.

The types here define the foundation for characters, abilities, items, and core mechanics across the system.

## About MOD20

MOD20 is a customizable TTRPG framework. It keeps the structure and feel of 5e but opens things up for more flexibility, homebrew content, and system hacks.

## What's Included

- Character interfaces and attributes
- Mechanics like dice, modifiers, and actions
- System references like classes and backgrounds
- Common shared utility types
